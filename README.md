# comparing-trajectory-clustering-methods

This was my pattern recognition course term project. The goal is to compare 4 clustering algorithms (k-medoids, gaussian mixture model, dbscan and hdbscan) on civil flight data. More detail can be found in report.pdf file.

Trajectory segmentation is applied to reduce the number of sample points and hausdorff distance is used to compare the similarity between trajectories.

Code is mess, I'll try to clean it up when I have time but the pdf report should be enough to get an idea.
